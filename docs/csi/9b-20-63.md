Title: (TCC) Tabulation Centered On Character
Description: Center text on a character.

Sets a tab stop at column `{c}` in the active line and of lines of subsequent text. Replaces any tab stop at the same location, but does not affect other tab stops. Strings are centered on the tab stop on the first occurrence of the character within the string. If the character does not appear, the text will be left aligned to the tab stop.

`{t}` is a decimal value of a character to match. It defaults to `32`, which is a space. Allowed values for `{t}` are `32`-`127` and also includes `160`-`255` for 8-bit codes.
