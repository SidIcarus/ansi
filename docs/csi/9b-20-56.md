Title: (SLH) Set Line Limit
Description: Sets the ending position for lines.

Sets position `{n}` in the active line to be the end position for the active line and subsequent lines of text. Carriage Return and Next Line will use this position if their Set Implicit Movement Direction is set to `1`. This remains in effect until the next Set Line Limit command.
